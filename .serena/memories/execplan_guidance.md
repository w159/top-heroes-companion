[Type: Pattern]
[Context: ExecPlan | Source: https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/codex_exec_plans#purpose--big-picture]
[Summary: ExecPlan should start with purpose/big-picture and stay concise, actionable, and updatable.]
[Details:
- Purpose + big picture first: what is being built/changed and why it matters to the user.
- Define scope and non-goals; note constraints/assumptions and dependencies.
- Break into ordered steps with success criteria/checkpoints and ownership.
- Include risks and mitigations; capture open questions/blockers.
- Add validation plan (tests/QA) and rollout/rollback notes if relevant.
- Keep it short; update as tasks complete to reflect current state.
