# Oath of Sacred Forest

**Faction**: Nature
**Type**: Set (3-Piece Core)
**Focus**: Sustain, Crowd Control (CC), Damage Reduction

## Overview

The "Oath" set is the backbone of the Nature meta. Nature teams win by outliving the opponent, and this set provides the damage reduction and "Entangle" crowd control needed to stall the game while your DoTs (Damage over Time) kill the enemy.

## Components

### 1. Undefeated Crown

**Role**: Defense / Sustain
**Ability**: _Shelter of Nature_

- Reduces maximum damage taken by the team.
- Periodically heals the team based on max HP.
- **Synergy**: Works perfectly with **Treant** and **Cactini** to create an unkillable frontline.

### 2. Vineborn Bow

**Role**: Offense / CC
**Ability**: _Entangle_

- Roots enemies, preventing movement.
- **Bonus Damage**: Deals +10% damage per Nature hero on the team (Max 60% with full Nature team).

### 3. Sacred Scroll

**Role**: Utility / Shield Breaker
**Ability**: _Nature's Truth_

- Provides a shield to the weakest ally.
- **Anti-Shield**: Deals bonus damage to shielded enemies (Counters League teams).

## Set Bonuses

- **2-Piece**: Increases "Entangle" duration by **0.5s**.
- **3-Piece**: Increases "Shelter of Nature" duration and effectiveness by **15%**.
- **Max Star Bonus**: Reduces enemy relic effectiveness by 50% if your Star Level is higher.

## Strategy

- **Priority**: Max the **Vineborn Bow** first for the damage and CC duration.
- **Counter**: Strong against "Burst" teams (Horde) due to the damage cap from Undefeated Crown.
