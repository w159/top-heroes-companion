**Faction**: League
**Type**: Set (3-Piece Core)

## Components

### 1. Petrification Staff

**Role**: Hard CC
**Ability**: _Medusa's Gaze_

- **Petrify**: Turns enemies to stone, stunning them and increasing damage taken.
- **Key Stat**: This is the most important relic in the set.

### 2. Soul Guard Orb

**Role**: Defense
**Ability**: _Soul Resist_

- Caps incoming damage at a % of max HP (Anti-Horde mechanic).
- Generates shields for League heroes.

### 3. Feather of Pact

**Role**: Buff / Block Break
**Ability**: _Arcane Pact_

- Increases Shield value for all allies.
- **Block Break**: League heroes ignore a portion of enemy defense.

## Set Bonuses

- **2-Piece**: **Petrify Duration +1s**. (This is huge for PvP).
- **3-Piece**: Increases Skill Damage vs Petrified targets by **20%**.
- **Max Star Bonus**: Reduces enemy relic effectiveness by 50% if your Star Level is higher.

## Strategy

- **Priority**: **Petrification Staff** is the absolute priority. An extra second of stun often decides the match.
- **Synergy**: Essential for **Paragon** and **Rose Princess**.
