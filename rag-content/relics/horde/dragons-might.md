"Dragon's Might" is the pure aggression set for the Horde. Unlike Nature (Sustain) or League (Control), this set focuses on **killing the enemy fast**. It uses "Thunderbind" to stop enemies from kiting while you drop massive AoE nuke damage.

## Components

### 1. Thunder Judgment

**Role**: AoE Damage / CC
**Ability**: _Thunderbind_

- Deals AoE lightning damage to **ALL** enemies.
