# Relic System Guide

Relics are powerful artifacts that provide **Passive Stats**, **Active Skills**, and **Set Bonuses**. Unlike gear, which is hero-specific, Relics are often faction-bound or universal, and their "Set Bonuses" are critical for defining a team's playstyle.

## Mechanics Overview

- **Unlock Condition**: Mid-game (Tavern unlock).
- **Relic Hall**: The building that manages your relics. Upgrading this increases your Relic Power and unlocks slots.
- **Set Bonuses**: Equipping 2, 4, or 6 pieces of a specific set unlocks powerful passive effects.

## Rarity & Stars

- **Rarity**: Rare (Blue) -> Epic (Purple) -> Legendary (Gold) -> Mythic (Red).
- **Star Levels**:
  - Unlocked by feeding **Relic Shards** and Gold.
  - **Rule of Thumb**: A **5-Star Epic Relic** is often stronger than a **1-Star Legendary Relic**. Do not rush to switch to Gold if you cannot star it up.
  - **Max Star Bonus**: Reaching max stars on a set unlocks a massive "Stat Dampening" effect on enemies (halving their relic effectiveness).

## Upgrade Resources

### Relic Shards

- **Source**:
  - **Legion Boss**: Daily attacks drop random shards.
  - **Events**: "Wish for Relic".
  - **Tavern**: Relic Summon.
- **Cost**: Costs scale exponentially.
  - _Example_: Level 1 -> 2 might cost 12 shards. Level 9 -> 10 might cost 70+.

### Relic Scrolls

The currency used to summon relics in the Tavern.

- **Strategy**: Save scrolls for "Relic Rush" events to double-dip on rewards.

## Strategic Tips

1.  **Focus Faction Sets**: Do not mix and match randomly. The **Set Bonus** (e.g., +1s Stun Duration) is worth more than raw stats.
2.  **One at a Time**: Max one relic's stars before moving to the next. The "Star Bonus" breakpoints are massive.
3.  **Guild Store**: Buy your daily/weekly Relic Scrolls. It is mandatory for progression.
