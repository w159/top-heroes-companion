# Guild Duel

**Frequency**: Weekly
**Type**: Guild vs Guild PvP

## Overview

Guild Duel allows your guild to set up defensive lines and attack another guild's lines. It is an automated PvP mode where strategy in **Banning** and **Counter-Picking** determines the winner.

## Mechanics

### 1. The Lines

Guilds set up 3 lines of defense (Top, Mid, Bottom or similar configuration).

- **Strongest Players**: Usually placed as "Gatekeepers" to stop momentum.

### 2. Ban/Pick Phase

- **Bans**: Guild leaders can ban specific heroes.
  - **Meta Ban**: Banning **Tidecaller** or **Pixie** disrupts the standard Nature sustain teams.
  - **Carry Ban**: Banning **Paragon** cripples League teams.
- **Strategy**: Look at the enemy's top players. If they are all League mains, ban Paragon.

### 3. Combat

- Attacks are auto-resolved.
- **Charm Arrows**: Guild members donate these to buff the stats of the dueling heroes. **Maximize donations** on duel days.

## Meta Tips

- **Defense**: Nature teams (Tidecaller/Treant) are the best defenders because they can time-out attacks.
- **Offense**: Horde teams (Flickerkit/Storm Maiden) are best for breaking a stalemated defense.
