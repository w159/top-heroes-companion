# Kingdom War (KvK)

**Frequency**: Periodic (roughly monthly)
**Type**: Server vs Server War

## Overview

KvK is the ultimate test of a server's strength. It is a 6-day event where two servers compete in development metrics, culminating in a 24-hour war.

## The 6-Day Schedule

### Day 1: Construction & Relics

- **Action**: Upgrade Buildings and Relics.
- **Prep**: Have major buildings ready to finish. Hoard Relic Shards for weeks.

### Day 2: Tech Boost

- **Action**: Technology Research.
- **Prep**: Hoard Research Speedups.

### Day 3: Global Battles

- **Action**: Gathering and PvE.
- **Strategy**: Send gatherers out _before_ reset so they return with full loads immediately. Kill high-level Wild Bosses.

### Day 4: Call of the Hero

- **Action**: Recruit Heroes, Awakening, Shards.
- **Prep**: **SAVE ALL RECRUITMENT TOKENS**. This is the biggest point swing day. Dump thousands of tokens here.

### Day 5: Combat Ready

- **Action**: Troop Training & Pets.
- **Prep**: Hoard Pet Food and Training Speedups.

### Day 6: War Day (Saturday)

- **Action**: PvP.
  - Kill Enemy Troops.
  - Occupy Enemy Castles.
  - **Heal Wounded Troops**.
- **Strategy**: Teleport to the enemy server. Hitting weaker castles gives points, but organized rallies on the Capital are the goal.
- **Tip**: Healing wounded troops gives massive points. Some players intentionally wound T1 troops just to heal them cheaply.

## Preparation Checklist

1.  **Hoard Everything**: If it's not Arms Race, don't spend it. If it is Arms Race, spend only enough to hit the daily cap. Save the rest for KvK.
2.  **Shields**: Buy 24h/8h shields. If you lose your shield during War Day, you will be zeroed.
3.  **Guild Coordination**: Join voice chat. Follow the whale rallies.
