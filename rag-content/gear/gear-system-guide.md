# Gear System Guide

Gear provides the raw stats (Attack, HP, Defense) for your heroes. Unlike Pets or Relics, gear is **Hero Specific**, meaning you must equip and upgrade a set for _each_ hero individually.

## Rarity Tier List

1.  **Mythic (Red)**: The current endgame standard.
2.  **Legendary (Gold)**: The minimum standard for your main team.
    - _T1/T2_: Legendary gear has sub-tiers (Tier 1 vs Tier 2) that determine max upgrade levels.
3.  **Epic (Purple)**: Transitional gear.
4.  **Rare/Uncommon (Blue/Green)**: Fodder.

## Gear Sets

Top Heroes uses a "Set Effect" system. Equipping 2 or 4 pieces of the same named set unlocks powerful bonuses.

- **Fury of Blood**: The Tank/Sustain set.
- **Glory of the Knight**: The DPS/Skill set.

## Upgrade Systems

### 1. Enhancement (Leveling)

- **Resource**: Enhancement Runes + Gold + **Rubies**.
- **The Ruby Wall**:
  - Up to Level 40: Ruby cost is negligible.
  - **Level 40+**: Ruby costs skyrocket.
  - _Example_: Level 10 (~14k Rubies) vs Level 30 (~32k Rubies).

### 2. Promotion (Stars)

- **Unlock**: Gear Level 40.
- **Resource**: Promotion Stones + Gold Bricks.
- **Effect**: Massively increases the base stats of the gear.

## Titan Marks

A special modification slot that adds **Faction-Specific** bonuses to gear (e.g., "Horde Damage +5%").

- **Dismantling**: If you dismantle gear, you get your Titan Marks and Runes back, but lose some of the invested Gold/Rubies.
