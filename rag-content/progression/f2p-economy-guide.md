# F2P Economy Guide

This guide covers optimal resource management for free-to-play players.

## Diamond Management

### Priority Purchases

1. **Second Construction Queue** (~500 diamonds) - Best early investment
2. **Event participation** - Save for events
3. **VIP level boosts** - Long-term benefit

### Never Buy

- Random hero summons (bad odds)
- Speed-ups outside events
- Cosmetics before progression items

## Daily Diamond Sources

- Daily quests: ~50
- Adventure chest: ~10-30
- Events: Variable
- Achievement milestones

## Resource Bundles Strategy

### Keep in Bag

Resources in your bag are **safe from PvP raids**:

- Food bundles
- Wood bundles
- Stone bundles
- Gold bundles

### When to Use

- During events (maximize points)
- When needed for specific upgrade
- Never use "just because"

## Weekly Must-Dos

| Activity            | Resource                | Priority  |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | --------- |
| Guild Store         | Pet Eggs, Relic Scrolls | MANDATORY |
| Legion Boss         | Relic shards            | MANDATORY |
| Bounty Hall         | Pet resources           | HIGH      |
| Daily quests        | Diamonds                | HIGH      |
| Event participation | Varies                  | HIGH      |

## Building Priorities

### Free Upgrades

- Focus required buildings for Castle
- Upgrade in order of Castle requirements
- Don't upgrade non-essential buildings early

### Speedup Usage

- Save for events (Arms Race, etc.)
- Use during events for double value
- Never waste on random upgrades

## Hero Investment

### F2P Hero Priorities

| Faction | F2P Heroes                             |
| ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| League  | Pyromancer, Secret Keeper, Adjudicator |
| Horde   | Heroes with farmable shards            |
| Nature  | Pixie, Forest Maiden                   |

### Shard Management

- Focus 5-6 heroes only
- Save Universal Shards for Mythic
- Don't spread across too many heroes

## Pet Economy

### Focus Strategy

- **One pet only** from your faction
- All Pet Food → that one pet
- Save Pet Essence for Mythic promotion

### F2P Pet Choices

| Faction | Best F2P Pet |
| ------- | ------------ |
| League  | Eggy         |
| Horde   | Howli (Wolf) |
| Nature  | Cactini      |

## Event Optimization

### Preparation

- Save resources before known events
- Stockpile speedups
- Don't use materials between events

### Maximum Value

- Complete event milestones
- Don't overspend past milestones
- Focus on best reward tiers

## Castle Progression

### Speed Priority

- Rush Castle to level 25
- Unlocks essential content
- Raises hero/soldier caps

### Bottleneck Resources

- Rubies (mine on home + world map)
- Research materials
- Specific building materials

## Mistakes to Avoid

### #1: Spreading Resources

Focus beats breadth. 5 strong heroes > 15 weak heroes.

### #2: Using Diamonds Poorly

Events > random purchases. Always.

### #3: Ignoring Guild

Guild provides free resources. Join and participate.

### #4: Hoarding Too Long

Use resources during events, not indefinitely.

### #5: Wrong Hero Investments

Don't invest in Rare heroes. Focus Legendary+.
