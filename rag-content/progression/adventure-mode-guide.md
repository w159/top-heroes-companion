# Adventure Mode Guide

Adventure Mode is your primary source of early-game gear, hero shards, and resources.

## Overview

- **Purpose**: Obtain gear, weapons, hero shards
- **Structure**: Zones with portal bosses connecting areas
- **Modes**: Normal → Hard Mode (after 100% completion)

## Zone Progression

### Classic Map

1. Complete Normal mode first
2. Explore 100% of each zone (hidden paths, secret chests)
3. Unlock Hard Mode for better loot (Legendary gear)

### Season Maps

- Season 1: Introduces new mechanics (water percentage, Spring of Nature)
- Season 2+: Extended levels and challenges
- Requires 100% previous world completion to unlock next

## Exploration Tips

### Hidden Content

- Look for subtle "hidden decorations" in environment
- Aid stranded soldiers for bonus rewards
- Every zone has secret chests off the main path

### Complete Each Zone 100%

- Unlocks bonus rewards
- Required for next world
- Reveals all treasure and secrets

## Stamina Management

### Boss Chests

- Require stamina to open
- Daily limit on stamina-gated chests
- Prioritize highest-value bosses

### Passive Chest

- Accumulates rewards over time (even offline)
- Claim periodically, don't let it cap
- **Don't** use 20 stamina for 2-hour clock icon (not worth it)

### Daily Stamina

- Never let it cap out
- Use on boss farming when stuck
- Save some for new zone pushes

## Boss Farming Strategy

### When Stuck

1. Identify the strongest boss you can reliably beat
2. Farm repeatedly for gear and shards
3. Upgrade your team, then push forward

### Limited Loot

- Bosses have limited loot drops
- Move to next boss once depleted
- Some bosses have unique drops worth farming

## Special Mechanics

### Season 1: Water Percentage

- Low water = severe debuffs
- Upgrade Spring of Nature building
- Maintain water levels to avoid penalties

### Spectral Dragon Boss

- Use Eternal Wings relic (recommended)
- Specific mechanics require adapted strategy
