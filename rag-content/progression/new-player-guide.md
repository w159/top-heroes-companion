# New Player Progression Guide

This guide covers the essential steps for new players to maximize early progress and avoid common mistakes.

## First Week Priorities

### Day 1-3: Foundation

1. **Complete Tutorial** - Follow all guided steps
2. **Join a Guild** - Unlocks at Castle Level 7
   - Aim for Top 5 guild on your server
   - Active guilds provide crucial resources
3. **Start Adventure Mode** - Your primary early-game content
4. **Set Up Idle Resources** - AFK rewards accumulate even offline

### Day 4-7: Growth

1. **Push Castle to Level 20-25** - This is critical
   - Unlocks essential buildings
   - Increases hero/soldier level cap
2. **Focus on ONE Faction** - Pick League, Horde, or Nature
3. **Upgrade Key Buildings** - Research Cottage, Hospital, Training Ground
4. **Complete Daily Activities** - Bounties, carriages, plunder

## Faction Selection Guide

### League (Recommended for Beginners)

**Pros**:

- Easiest to build early
- Pyromancer is a strong early carry
- Many accessible heroes

**Cons**:

- Becomes resource-intensive late game
- Requires specific compositions

**Core Heroes**: Pyromancer, Secret Keeper, Adjudicator

### Horde (Recommended for Patient Players)

**Pros**:

- Strongest late-game PvE damage
- Wanderer is a premier carry
- Excellent for boss content

**Cons**:

- Slow early development
- Meta builds take time

**Core Heroes**: Wanderer, Desert Prince, Storm Maiden

### Nature (Hardest Early, Strong Late)

**Pros**:

- Best sustain and survivability
- Tidecaller is top-tier carry
- Strong in extended fights

**Cons**:

- Early Nature heroes are weak
- Requires replacing early heroes later

**Core Heroes**: Tidecaller, Pixie, Forest Maiden

## Resource Management

### DO

- ✅ Save resource bundles in bag (safe from PvP)
- ✅ Reserve diamonds for events
- ✅ Focus Pet Food on ONE pet
- ✅ Save Legendary Universal Shards for Mythic heroes

### DON'T

- ❌ Spread resources across too many heroes
- ❌ Invest in Rare (blue) heroes
- ❌ Waste diamonds on non-event purchases
- ❌ Use resource bundles before Castle 25+

## Building Priority

| Priority | Building         | Why                 |
| -------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| 1        | Castle           | Unlocks everything  |
| 2        | Research Cottage | Tech tree bonuses   |
| 3        | Training Ground  | Soldier strength    |
| 4        | Barracks         | Troop capacity      |
| 5        | Hospital         | Heal troops faster  |
| 6        | Faction Statues  | March size increase |

## Hero Investment Priority

1. **DPS First** - Your damage dealers win fights
2. **Tanks Second** - Keep DPS alive
3. **Support Third** - Amplify your team
4. **Utilities Last** - Situational heroes

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### #1: Spreading Resources

> Focus on 5-6 main heroes maximum. A strong core team beats a mediocre wide roster.

### #2: Ignoring Castle Upgrades

> Castle level = power ceiling. Push to 25+ ASAP.

### #3: Missing Daily Activities

- Bounties (4x daily)
- Carriages (4x daily)
- Legion Boss hits
- Stamina spending (don't cap!)

### #4: Weak Guild

> A Top 5 guild provides: Guild Store, Rally rewards, Speedups, Social bonuses

### #5: Investing in Wrong Heroes

> Avoid Rare heroes. Focus on Legendary+ that can scale to Mythic.
