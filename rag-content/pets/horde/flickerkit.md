# Flickerkit (Fire Cat)

**Faction**: Horde
**Rarity**: Legendary
**Role**: Burst Damage & Buffs

## Overview

Flickerkit (commonly called the "Fire Cat") is the **Best-in-Slot** pet for Horde teams. It is widely considered the strongest offensive pet in the game due to Horde's dominance in burst damage.

## Skills

### Active: Flame Burst

Deals massive AoE damage to enemy teams.

### Passive: Horde Ferocity

Significantly boosts **All Horde Hero Attack** and **HP**.

- **4-Star Rare Stats**: ~25.5% Attack / ~37.5% HP (Example scaling).

## Stat Bonuses

Provides massive scaling for Horde heroes. Like other faction pets, it outperforms generic pets by ~300% for its specific faction.

## Strategy

- **Acquisition**: Notoriously difficult for F2P players ("Paywalled" often). Found in premium Selection Chests.
- **Alternative**: If you cannot get Flickerkit, use **Howli (Wolf)**.
- **Synergy**: Essential for **Storm Maiden** and **Soul Ripper** to maximize that first 10-second burst window.
