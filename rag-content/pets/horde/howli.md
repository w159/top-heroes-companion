# Howli (Wolf)

**Faction**: Horde
**Rarity**: Epic/Legendary
**Role**: Balanced Offense

## Overview

Howli is the reliable **F2P Alternative** to Flickerkit for Horde players. While it lacks the sheer raw stat ceiling of a maxed Flickerkit, it is much easier to obtain and star-up.

## Skills

### Active: Howl

Buffs nearby allies' Attack Speed or Damage for a short duration.

### Passive: Pack Tactics

Increases Horde hero stats slightly.

## Strategy

- **F2P King**: For a free-to-play Horde main, a 5-Star Howli will outperform a 1-Star Flickerkit.
- **Investment**: Do not use Pet Essence on Howli if you plan to eventually switch to Flickerkit.
