# Cubbly (Bear)

**Faction**: Universal (Generic)
**Rarity**: Epic/Legendary
**Role**: Generalist Tank

## Overview

Cubbly (often just called "The Bear") is the robust, generic starter pet. It does not belong to a specific faction meta but provides universal buffs.

## Skills

### Active: Bear Hug

Taunts or stuns a single enemy / deals damage.

### Passive: Thick Fur

Increases Defense of all heroes.

## Stat Bonuses

Provides **All Hero Attack** and **All Hero HP**.

- **Weakness**: These buffs are ~33% as effective as Faction-specific buffs (e.g., Cactini gives 3x more stats to Nature heroes).

## Strategy

- **Early Game**: Excellent placeholder while you farm for your specific faction pet.
- **Late Game**: Falls off hard. Do not invest Pet Essence here.
