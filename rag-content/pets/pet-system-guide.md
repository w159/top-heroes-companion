# Pet System Guide

Pets are essential companions unlocked in **Season 1** that provide massive stat boosts and unique skills to your heroes. Unlike gear, **pets provide bonuses to ALL heroes of their faction** (or all heroes generally) when promoted, even if they are not the active pet in the queue.

## Mechanics Overview

- **Unlock Condition**: Season 1
- **Buildings**:
  - **Pet Paradise**: Where you view, level, and promote pets.
  - **Pet Food Factory**: Passively produces Pet Food over time.
- **Max Level**: 120 (requires promotion to Mythic to exceed).

## Pet Types & Rarity

Pets come in three main rarities:

- **Rare (Blue)**: Basic pets, easier to find. Used primarily as fodder for promotions later.
- **Epic (Purple)**: Stronger, good for F2P early game.
- **Legendary (Gold)**: The standard meta pets.
- **Mythic (Red)**: The highest tier, reached via promotion.

## Faction Bonuses

The most important mechanic to understand is **Faction Scaling**.

- **Generic Pets** (e.g., Cubbly/Bear) give "All Hero Attack/HP" buffs.
- **Faction Pets** (e.g., Cactini, Eggy) give "All [Faction] Hero Attack/HP" buffs.

> **CRITICAL**: Faction-specific bonuses are approximately **3x stronger** than generic bonuses. Always prioritize the pet that matches your team's main faction.

## Leveling & Resources

### Pet Food

- **Source**: Pet Food Factory, Adventure Mode, Events.
- **Strategy**: **DO NOT SPLIT XP.** Focus 100% of your food on your main pet. A single Level 100 pet is worth far more than three Level 40 pets.

### Pet Essence

Required to promote a pet from **Legendary to Mythic** (Level 120 breakpoint).

- **Source**: Pet Rush Event (Best source), Guild Store (Weekly limit), Late-game Adventure.
- **Cost**: Extremely expensive/scare. Save ALL essence for your main faction pet.

## Promotion System (Star Upgrading)

Promoting pets increases their "Passive Attribute Bonus" (the global stat buff).

| Target Rarity | Requirement Example (Estimated) |
|HIERARCHY|COST|
|---|---|
| **Rare → Rare+** | 1x Duplicate |
| **Rare+ → Epic** | 1x Duplicate + Random Rares |
| **Epic → Legendary** | Multiple Duplicates + Random Rares |
| **Legendary → Mythic** | ~57 Total Copies + Pet Essence |

_Note: You need approximately 23 copies of a pet to reach basic Legendary status._

## Acquisition

- **Pet Eggs**:
  - **Guild Store**: Buy 3x Rare Eggs weekly (Mandatory).
  - **Bounty Hall**: Refresh bounties to find Pet Eggs.
- **Selection Chests**: The only reliable way to get specific meta pets like Flickerkit or Cactini.
