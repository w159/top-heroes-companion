# Cactini

**Faction**: Nature
**Rarity**: Legendary
**Role**: Sustain & Debuff

## Overview

Cactini is the **Best-in-Slot (BiS)** pet for all Nature mains. It defines the Nature meta by synergizing with the faction's high HP and sustain capabilities, providing massive stat multipliers that generic pets cannot match.

## Skills

### Active: Spike Barrage

Deals damage to 2 random enemy units.
_Exact damage % scales with level._

### Passive: Critical Dampening

Decreases the Critical Rate of opponents. This makes your Nature team (already tanky) even harder to burst down.

## Stat Bonuses (Global)

Cactini provides **All Nature Hero Attack** and **All Nature Hero HP**.

- **Base (Level 1)**: ~5.1% Attack / ~7.5% HP
- **Scaling**: Increases with Star Level and Pet Level.
- **Comparison**: Provides ~3x the stats of a generic pet (like Cubbly) for Nature heroes.

## Strategy

- **Prioritize**: If you run Nature (Tidecaller, Sage, Treant), Cactini is you #1 priority.
- **Synergy**: Works perfectly with **Tidecaller** and **Treant** to prolong fights, allowing poison/burn damage to tick.
