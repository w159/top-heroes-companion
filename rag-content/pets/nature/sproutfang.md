# Sproutfang

**Faction**: Nature
**Rarity**: Legendary
**Role**: Offensive Alternative

## Overview

Sproutfang is the offensive alternative to Cactini for Nature teams. While Cactini focuses on survivability (Meta), Sproutfang offers more direct damage output.

## Skills

### Active: Venom Bite

Deals damage to enemies and applies a poison/DoT effect.

### Passive: Nature's Wrath

Increases damage dealt by Nature heroes.

## Strategy

- **Usage**: Generally considered secondary to **Cactini** because Nature teams win by out-sustaining, not out-bursting.
- **F2P Status**: Often easier to obtain than Cactini in early events, but falls off in the late game compared to Cactini's percent-stat scaling.
