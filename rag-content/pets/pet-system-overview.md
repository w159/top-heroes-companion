# Pet System Guide

Pets provide significant stat boosts and faction-specific bonuses. Proper pet management is crucial for maximizing team power.

## Pet Basics

- **Unlock**: Season 1
- **Location**: Pet Paradise (leveling), Pet Food Factory (resources)
- **Max Level**: 120 (then promote to Mythic)

## Faction-Specific Pets

### League Pets

| Pet      | Specialty           | Recommendation   |
| -------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Eggy** | Critical Rate buffs | **Best in Slot** |
| Zappy    | AoE focus           | Alternative      |
| CandiBoo | Season 3 option     | Good for S3      |

**Why Eggy?**: Massive Critical Rate scaling that grows with your team. Promotion bonuses give "All League Hero Attack" and "All League Hero HP".

### Nature Pets

| Pet         | Specialty            | Recommendation   |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Cactini** | Sustain/Stat scaling | **Best in Slot** |
| Sproutfang  | Alternative          | Secondary        |
| Bear        | Generic              | F2P fallback     |

**Why Cactini?**: Superior stat scaling for Nature's sustain-focused meta. Essential for late-game Nature teams.

### Horde Pets

| Pet            | Specialty       | Recommendation           |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Flickerkit** | All Horde buffs | **Best in Slot** (P2W)   |
| Howli (Wolf)   | Balanced        | **Best F2P Alternative** |
| Other          | Varies          | Avoid                    |

**Why Flickerkit?**: "All Horde Hero Attack" and "All Horde Hero HP" bonuses. However, it's paywalled and hard to obtain for F2P.

## Leveling Strategy

### Core Principle

> **Focus 100% of Pet Food on ONE pet that matches your main faction.**

A Level 100+ pet provides exponentially more value than multiple Level 30 pets.

### Level Milestones

| Level | Milestone                        |
| ----- | -------------------------------- |
| 30    | Star upgrades unlock (Rare pets) |
| 60    | Significant stat boost           |
| 100   | Major power spike                |
| 120   | Mythic promotion available       |

## Pet Essence (Mythic Promotion)
