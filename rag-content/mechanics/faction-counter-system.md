# Faction Counter System

The three factions in Top Heroes form a rock-paper-scissors counter system that significantly impacts battle outcomes.

## Faction Triangle

```
        HORDE
       /     \
      /       \
  beats     loses to
    /           \
LEAGUE ←——————→ NATURE
      loses to / beats
```

### Counter Relationships

| Attacker   | Strong Against | Weak Against |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| **Horde**  | League         | Nature       |
| **Nature** | Horde          | League       |
| **League** | Nature         | Horde        |

## Battle Impact

When a hero attacks an enemy they have faction advantage over:

- **Damage Dealt**: Increased by ~25-30%
- **Damage Received**: Reduced by ~15-20%

## Strategic Implications

### Team Building

1. **Single Faction Focus**: Stick to one faction to maximize faction bonuses

   - 4 Legendary+ heroes: +15% ATK/HP
   - 5 Legendary+ heroes: +25% ATK/HP
   - 6 Legendary+ heroes: +35% ATK/HP

2. **Counter Picking in PvP**: When scouting enemies, build counter-teams
   - Facing Horde? Bring Nature
   - Facing Nature? Bring League
   - Facing League? Bring Horde

### Arena Strategy

- Scout opponent's faction before attacking
- Keep heroes from all factions leveled for counter-play
- Nature's sustain can overcome unfavorable matchups

### KvK (Kingdom War)

- Coordinate with guild to cover all faction weaknesses
- Horde excels at burst damage rallies
- Nature provides staying power in prolonged fights
- League offers strong CC (crowd control)
