# Bond System Guide

Top Heroes features two distinct bond systems that provide significant stat boosts.

## Team Bonds (Direct Synergy)

When specific heroes are deployed together, they activate special bonuses.

### Damage Reduction Bonds (+10%)

| Heroes Required                  |
| -------------------------------- |
| Pyromancer + Secret Keeper + Nun |
| Swordmaster + Shaman + Warlock   |
| Treeguard + Tidecaller + Sage    |

### Damage Increase Bonds (+10%)

| Heroes Required                            |
| ------------------------------------------ |
| Astrologer + Adjudicator + Paragon         |
| Treeguard + Forest Maiden + Pixie          |
| Desert Prince + Storm Maiden + Beastmaster |

### Attack Speed Bonds (+10%)

| Heroes Required                 |
| ------------------------------- |
| Wanderer + Witch + Warlock      |
| Bishop + Artificer + Pyromancer |

## Global Hero Bonds (Roster-Wide)

Collecting specific heroes provides permanent stat bonuses to ALL your heroes.

### How It Works

1. Each "bond group" contains 3-5 related heroes
2. Collecting the first hero unlocks initial bonus
3. More heroes from the group = bigger bonuses
4. Bonuses apply even if heroes aren't in your active team

### Bond Bonus Types

- Attack +%
- HP +%
- Speed +%
- Defense +%

### Unlocking Bond Points

- **Guild Mobilization** event
- **Collection achievements**
- **Story mode completion**

## Strategic Recommendations

### Early Game

- Team Bonds matter less than raw hero power
- Focus on getting strong heroes, not bond combinations
- Global Bonds are a nice bonus, not a priority

### Mid Game

- Start considering Team Bonds for synergy
- Build around 2-3 bond sets for your main team
- Global Bonds accumulate naturally

### Late Game

- Faction bonuses often outweigh Team Bonds
- Use Team Bonds for specific PvE challenges
- Max Global Bonds for overall roster strength

## Bond Priority Order

1. **Faction Bonus** (35% ATK/HP with 6 heroes)
2. **Hero Quality** (Mythic > Legendary > Epic)
3. **Gear/Relic Sets** (matching bonuses)
4. **Team Bonds** (nice-to-have, not essential)
