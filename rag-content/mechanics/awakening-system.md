## Soul Stone Acquisition

### Weekly Sources

- **Star Gem Shop**: 2 per faction (limited weekly)
- **Events**: Pet Rush, Awakening events
- **Packs**: Various in-game purchases

### Faction-Specific

Each faction has its own Soul Stone type:

- League Soul Stones (purple)
- Horde Soul Stones (red)
- Nature Soul Stones (green)

## Awakening Priority by Faction

### League Faction

1. **Pyromancer** - Top DPS, awaken to Tier 2 early
2. **Adjudicator** - Essential tank survivability
3. **Secret Keeper** - Shield support

### Horde Faction

1. **Warlock** - PvE boost, attack speed aura
2. **Barbarian** - Tank HP and shields
3. **Wanderer** - Late-game carry

### Nature Faction

1. **Pixie** - Early DPS carry
2. **Forest Maiden** - Sustain healer
3. **Sage** - Bear summon + shields

## Strategic Considerations

### Cost vs Value

- Awakening is resource-intensive (~115 copies + 9 Soul Stones)
- Natural Mythics may be more F2P-efficient
- Prioritize heroes you'll use long-term

### F2P Strategy

- Focus on ONE hero per faction for awakening
- Don't split resources across multiple awakenings
- Complete events that reward Soul Stones
