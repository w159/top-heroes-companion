# Core Hero Strategy

## Focus on One Faction
Don't spread resources thin. Pick one main faction (League, Horde, or Nature) to build a cohesive team quickly.

## Soldiers are Mandatory
Never fight without max soldiers. They account for a huge portion of your actual combat power.

## Save Universal Shards
Never use universal legendary shards on Legendary heroes. Save them exclusively for Mythic heroes.

## Manage Your Meat
Meat is a bottleneck. Do not level Blue/Purple heroes past 120. Focus all meat on your main queue.
