## Game Mode Specific Teams

### Campaign / Adventure Mode

**Focus**: Wave-clear, self-sustain, balanced composition

| Role         | Count | Examples                |
| ------------ | ----- | ----------------------- |
| Tank         | 2     | Frontline protection    |
| DPS          | 2     | Area damage preferred   |
| Support/Heal | 1-2   | Sustain for long fights |

**Tips**:

- Prioritize AoE damage for clearing mobs
- Self-healing heroes reduce potion usage
- Faction bonus important for tough zones

### Arena (PvP)

**Focus**: Speed, crowd control, burst damage

**Key Strategies**:

- Fast heroes act first (speed matters)
- CC heroes (stun/silence) disable threats
- Burst DPS eliminates targets quickly

**Meta Approach**:

1. Lead with CC (Petrification Staff relic)
2. Chain stuns into DPS ultimates
3. Focus enemy DPS first

### Guild Raids / Bosses

**Focus**: Burst damage, damage amplification

| Role               | Purpose                      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Damage Amp Support | Increase team damage         |
| Reliable Burst DPS | High single-target damage    |
| Survivability      | Stay alive for damage window |

**Tips**:

- Horde excels at boss damage
- Stack damage buffs before burst
- Coordinate with guild for compositions

## Team Building Principles

### Priority Order

1. **Faction Bonus** (35% ATK/HP at 6 heroes)
2. **Role Balance** (2 tanks, 2 DPS, 2 support)
3. **Hero Quality** (Mythic > Legendary > Epic)
4. **Bond Synergies** (nice bonus, not primary focus)

### Early Game Team

- Use what you have
- Don't force bonds over hero quality
- Focus resources on 5-6 heroes max

### Transitioning Mid-Late

- Replace Epic heroes with Legendary
- Work toward Mythic awakenings
- Complete faction set (6 heroes)

## Counter-Picking Guide

| Opponent     | Counter Faction | Key Heroes             |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| Heavy Nature | League          | Paragon, Pyromancer    |
| Heavy Horde  | Nature          | Tidecaller, Pixie      |
| Heavy League | Horde           | Wanderer, Storm Maiden |

### Arena Scout Strategy

1. Scout opponent's lineup
2. Identify dominant faction
3. Build counter-team
4. Repeat for each fight
